Here’s a list of topics you should cover to get a solid understanding of **GraphQL with NestJS**, progressing from basics to intermediate concepts:

### 1. **Introduction to GraphQL**
   - What is GraphQL?
   - Differences between REST and GraphQL
   - Benefits of using GraphQL
   - How GraphQL works (queries, mutations, resolvers, etc.)

### 2. **Setting Up GraphQL in NestJS**
   - Installing necessary packages: `@nestjs/graphql`, `graphql`, `apollo-server-express`
   - Configuring GraphQL in NestJS using `GraphQLModule`
   - Setting up Apollo Server with NestJS

### 3. **GraphQL Schema**
   - Understanding GraphQL types (scalars, objects, enums, etc.)
   - Writing GraphQL schemas using the SDL (Schema Definition Language)
   - Defining root types: Query, Mutation, Subscription
   - Auto-generating GraphQL schemas from TypeScript (code-first vs. schema-first approach)

### 4. **GraphQL Queries and Mutations**
   - Defining basic GraphQL queries and mutations
   - Implementing resolvers for queries and mutations
   - Sending queries and mutations to GraphQL using Apollo Playground/GraphQL tools

### 5. **Resolvers in NestJS**
   - Creating and organizing resolvers in NestJS
   - Working with `@Resolver()`, `@Query()`, and `@Mutation()` decorators
   - Handling GraphQL requests with NestJS services

### 6. **Input Types and Arguments**
   - Using `@Args()` and `@InputType()` to handle query and mutation arguments
   - Creating input types for complex mutations (e.g., nested objects)
   - Validating input using decorators like `@Validate()` with `class-validator`

### 7. **GraphQL Scalars**
   - Using built-in scalars like `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`
   - Custom Scalars (e.g., DateTime, JSON)
   - Implementing and registering custom scalar types

### 8. **Error Handling in GraphQL**
   - Handling errors in GraphQL queries and mutations
   - Using `@Catch()` and exception filters in NestJS
   - Custom error messages and formatting
   - Error propagation in GraphQL

### 9. **GraphQL Authentication and Authorization**
   - Integrating JWT authentication with GraphQL in NestJS
   - Protecting queries and mutations using guards (`@UseGuards()`)
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) with GraphQL
   - Using `@ResolveField()` for field-level authorization

### 10. **GraphQL Subscriptions**
   - Introduction to GraphQL subscriptions
   - Setting up WebSockets and `@Subscription()` in NestJS
   - Managing real-time events with subscriptions

### 11. **DataLoader and Batch Loading**
   - What is DataLoader and why it’s important for performance
   - Using DataLoader for batch loading and preventing N+1 queries
   - Integrating DataLoader with NestJS GraphQL

### 12. **Pagination and Filtering**
   - Implementing pagination in GraphQL (offset-based, cursor-based)
   - Filtering and sorting data with GraphQL queries
   - Best practices for pagination and filtering

### 13. **GraphQL Unions and Interfaces**
   - Understanding Unions and Interfaces in GraphQL
   - Defining and using GraphQL interfaces and unions in NestJS
   - Handling polymorphic types with resolvers

### 14. **Working with GraphQL Modules**
   - Organizing your application into modules with `GraphQLModule`
   - Structuring your application with multiple GraphQL resolvers and services
   - Sharing common types and services between modules

### 15. **File Uploads in GraphQL**
   - Implementing file uploads with GraphQL and Apollo Server
   - Handling multipart requests in NestJS
   - Uploading and serving files with GraphQL

### 16. **Testing GraphQL in NestJS**
   - Writing unit tests for resolvers using mocks
   - Integration testing GraphQL queries and mutations
   - Using Apollo Server testing tools

### 17. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies with GraphQL
   - Query complexity analysis and limiting query depth
   - Optimizing database queries (e.g., using Prisma or TypeORM efficiently)

### 18. **Deploying a GraphQL API**
   - Best practices for deploying a NestJS GraphQL API
   - Managing GraphQL API versioning
   - Security considerations for GraphQL endpoints (e.g., rate limiting, validation)

### Advanced Topics (Optional)
- **Federation with Apollo**: Understanding GraphQL federation for microservices
- **Schema Stitching**: Merging multiple GraphQL schemas into one
- **GraphQL Directives**: Creating custom GraphQL directives for schema-level logic
